### Trust... ###
At Purple Cow Properties we understand the level of trust it takes to hand over management of your property to an agent. Therefore, we ensure open communication, regular property/ tenant status updates, trusted qualified contractors and an efficient regular payment service.

### Revenue... ###
Purple Cow Properties knows that it is essential, particularly in todays challenging Investor Market, to maintain the profitability of your property portfolio. We achieve this by maximising rental income through various advertising strategies whilst minimising void periods and utilising our first hand knowledge of the current Letting Market.

### Time... ###
Purple Cow Properties recognises that Property Management is time consuming and that most investors would prefer to dedicate their time to other property areas or business interests. By allowing Purple Cow Properties to Manage your investment; we can ensure that any actions are being carried out efficiently and cost effectively.

Our first hand experience means Purple Cow Properties appreciates just how vital it is to ensure that tenants are vetted correctly. Additionally, we view the following proactive measures as essential to negate many issues that could occur during the tenancy period: professional credit checks; paperwork drawn up by our Solicitors and executed correctly; all current and future rental legislation adhered to.
